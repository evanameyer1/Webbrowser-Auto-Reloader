    <h1>Welcome to Chrome Timers!</h1>
    <p>We have two timer options: With timer intervals, you can control multiple timers at once, 
       all working on an pre-designated interval basis (you define the amount of time that will pass
       in between each webpage refresh). Our Timer Auto-Scheduler allows you to define timers that will 
       refresh automatically at a pre-designated time throughout the day.</p>
